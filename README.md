Sportorg is a comprehensive software solution developed in Python that streamlines the organization and execution of orienteering competitions. Orienteering is a sport that challenges participants to navigate through unfamiliar terrain using only a map and compass, testing their navigation and decision-making skills. This software aims to enhance the experience for both event organizers and participants by providing a user-friendly platform to manage various aspects of orienteering competitions.
